Here is the updated plan:

1.  Create New Directory Structure:

    - I will create a spots directory.
    - Inside spots, I will create a jeziorsko directory.

2.  Move and Reorganize Files:

    - I will move prognoza.html to spots/jeziorsko/prognoza.html.
    - I will move aktualne.html to spots/jeziorsko/aktualne.html.
    - I will move the current index.html (with the surfer image) to spots/jeziorsko/index.html, making it the main page for the Jeziorsko spot.
    - I will create a new, simple index.html at the project root to serve as the main homepage.

3.  Update Navigation and Links:
    - New Main Homepage (`/index.html`):
      - The navigation bar will have two links: "Kite Łódź" (linking to /index.html) and "Jeziorsko" (linking to /spots/jeziorsko/index.html).
    - Jeziorsko Spot Pages (`/spots/jeziorsko/*.html`):
      - I will update the navigation in all three files within the spots/jeziorsko/ directory.
      - The navigation on these pages will have three links: "Kite Łódź" (linking back to the main /index.html), "Prognoza" (linking to prognoza.html within the same directory), and "Aktualne" (linking to aktualne.html within the same directory).
      - All internal links will be updated to reflect the new file structure.

Does this revised plan meet your expectations?
