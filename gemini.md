# Collaboration Workflow

To ensure clarity and keep the project organized, we will follow this simple workflow for all new features or changes:

1.  **Goal Definition:** The user will state the goal for the new feature or change.
2.  **Feature Branch:** Gemini will create a new, descriptive Git branch for the work (e.g., `feature/add-contact-form`). All changes will be made on this branch.
3.  **Implementation:** Gemini will implement the feature on the branch.
4.  **Review:** The user will review the changes. Gemini will make adjustments based on feedback.
5.  **Merge:** Once approved, Gemini will merge the feature branch back into the `main` branch and delete the feature branch.
